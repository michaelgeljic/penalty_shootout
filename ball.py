# Ball physics and movement
# - Store ball position and velocity
# - Handle ball movement with physics (gravity, trajectory)
# - Apply friction and bouncing
# - Handle being "shot" with initial velocity
# - Reset ball position for new shots
# - Draw the ball
# - Detect when ball is out of bounds or stopped

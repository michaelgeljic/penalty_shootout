# Goalkeeper AI and movement
# - Start in center of goal
# - React to ball movement (with delay for realism/random direction diving)
# - Move towards predicted ball position
# - Add some randomness/error
# - Handle collision with ball
# - Reset position between shots
# - Draw goalkeeper character
# - Maybe add diving animations
